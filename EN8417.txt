An Old Man Lived in the Village


A man and his wife traveled to the zoo. They found a monkey that played passionately with his female. His wife told him: "What a romance." Then they found a lion and his lioness separated from each other; the lion was silent and alone in his corner as if the lioness did not exist. His wife told him: "What a sad scene without love." Her husband then told her: "throw that stone at the lioness and watch." When she threw it down, the lion leaped roaring to defend his lioness.
